                Hey, thanks for visiting my webiste! My name is Matt and I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student at
                the University of Waterloo. I'm currently working my third co-op placement at Bluescape as a QA
                Automation Engineer.
            </p>

            <p>
                My previous co-op term was spent at BlackBerry as a Systems Software Developer on the Gateway team.
                Before that, I was a Web and iOS developer for Pairrd. You can read more about my previous work
                experience and some of my projects on my
                <a href="./files/site_resume.pdf" class="underline">resume</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time I enjoy fishing, swimming, gaming, and playing cards with friends.
